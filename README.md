tabiah-presentation
===================

A flash-based multimedia presentation about a card game called Tabiah.
The presentation is a prototype and follows visual design elements and principles.

As a prototype, the presentation:
• Shows examples of all presentation styles to be used in the final product.
• Includes examples of all types of navigation to be employed.
• Indicates when material is missing or will be different in the final system

I had to read some books about design before creating the presentation, among them:
• Don't Make Me Think!: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Steve Krug
• DA Norman. The Design of Everyday Things, Basic Books
• Y Rogers, H Sharp and J Preece, Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction, Wiley
